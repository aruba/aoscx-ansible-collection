# 1. replace "NAMESPACE" and "COLLECTION_NAME" with the correct name in the env section (e.g. with 'community' and 'mycollection')
# 2. If you don't have unit tests remove that section
# 3. If your collection depends on other collections ensure they are installed, see "Install collection dependencies"
# If you need help please ask in #ansible-community on the Libera.chat IRC network
